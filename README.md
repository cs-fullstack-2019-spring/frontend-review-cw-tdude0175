### Problem 1:
Create a button with "Click Me". Once it's clicked, ask the user if they want to continue being asked to quit. If they enter 'n', stop asking. If they enter anything else, ask again.

### Problem 2:
Use the code above. Once the user enters 'n' to quit, print the total number of times they didn't enter 'n'.

### Problem 3:
Create a header that only goes half way across the screen and is blank on the other half. Create one section that goes all the way across the screen on the 2nd row. Lastly create a footer that's blank on the first half, but goes across to the end on the other half. DO NOT COPY THIS FROM YOUR LAST CLASSWORK. RETYPE EVERYTHING

### Challenge
Create a div with CodeCrew inside of it with a blue background and 20% width. Give it a class of flyingCodeCrew. In your javascript, when the key for down is press, make the relative position go down 10px. If the key for up is pressed, make the relative position go up for 10px. Do the same for left and right.

Note: Use document.onkeydown = [FUNCTION]; when getting all keyboard strikes. Note2: [ELEMENT].style.[DIRECTION] does not return a value. You have to keep up with it yourself or find a different way to call it.
